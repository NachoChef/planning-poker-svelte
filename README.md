## Developing

To run, you will need a `.env` file with the following: 

```text
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=""  
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=""
```

Once you've added those and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
